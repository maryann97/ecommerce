		Stackable storage in a bathroom vanity fills the vertical space and tidies up bathroom necessities. For example,in the picture below bins stack to the top of the vanity cabinet, and their open fronts keep everything accessible.

             You might be stuck with apartment finishes and materials that make your skin crawl, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have fabulous furniture.
			 Fill your space with pieces you love and the rest will seem to fade away. 
			 In every room, choose a statement furniture piece to become the focal point.

		<h1>Apartment Lighting</h1>
		Good lighting can completely transform a room, and its source doesn't need to be a hardwired ceiling fixture.
		Invest in lamps to place on end tables, nightstands, and side tables. Position floor lamps to illuminate dark corners, and hang plug-in sconces in hallways or above sofas. 
		Plug-in under cabinet lighting will give your kitchen work areas new life and make cooking tasks easier.</p>
